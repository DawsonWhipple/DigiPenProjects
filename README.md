# DigiPenProjects
The projects found in this repository are projects I created during my time at DigiPen through the WaNIC program in the 2017/2018 acedmeic year.
A majority of these projects were created using DigiPen's own propietary Zilch script using their Zero game engine. This game engine and coding language are designed to mimic other programs such as Unity and other languages such as C++ and Java but in a more acedmic setting. The Zilch script language is an object oriented language and meant to be embedded in C++.
The following is a list of all projects in this repository:
