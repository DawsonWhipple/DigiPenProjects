# DigiPenProjects
The projects found in this repository are projects I created during my time at DigiPen through the WaNIC program in the 2017/2018 acedmeic year.

A majority of these projects were created using DigiPen's own propietary Zilch script using their Zero game engine. This game engine and coding language are designed to mimic other programs such as Unity and other languages such as C++ and Java but in a more acedmic setting. The Zilch script language is an object oriented language and meant to be embedded in C++.

It should also be noted that these projects were created without the use of any sort of remote repository, as can be seen by the lack of proper git workflow exhibited. As such a simple .zip of each project has been uploaded here simply for archival.

The following is a list of all projects in this repository:
- Geometry Wars insipred wave based top down shooter (DigiPenFinalproject.zip)
- Survival 2D shooter, made for a game jam in the course (DigiPenGameJam1.zip)
- Yes/No Sort the Court style game, prompts user and gives a positive or negative outcome based on their choices (YesNoGame.zip)
